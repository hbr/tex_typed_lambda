\subsection{Parallel Reduction Relation}


\subsubsection{Definition of the Parallel Reduction Relation}

\begin{definition}
    The \emph{parallel reduction relation} $a \preduce b$ is defined inductively
    by the rules
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Reflexive
    $$
        a \preduce a
    $$

    \item Redex
    $$
        \rulev {
            a \preduce b
            \\
            e \preduce f
        }
        {
            (\lambda x^A. e) a \preduce f[x:=b]
        }
    $$

    \item Product
    $$
    \rulev {
        A \preduce C
        \\
        B \preduce D
    }
    {
        \Pi x^A. B \preduce \Pi x^C. D
    }
    $$

    \item Abstraction
    $$
    \rulev {
        A \preduce B
        \\
        e \preduce f
    }
    {
        \lambda x^A. e \preduce \lambda x^B. f
    }
    $$

    \item Application
    $$
    \rulev {
        a \preduce c
        \\
        b \preduce d
    }
    {
        a b \preduce c d
    }
    $$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}





\subsubsection{Some basic lemmas of the parallel reduction relation}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{ParallelReductionSubstitution1}
    \emph{Basic compatibility of parallel reduction and substitution}
    $$
    \rulev{
        t \preduce u
    }
    {
        a[x:=t] \preduce a[x:=u]
    }
    $$

    \begin{proof}
    By induction on the structure of $a$.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $a$ is a sort: Trivial, because substitution does not change a sort
    and reflexivity of the parallel beta reduction.

    \item $a$ is a variable, let's say $y$: In the case $x=y$ the goal is
    implied by the premise. In the case $x \ne y$ the goal is implied by
    reflexivity.

    \item $a$ is the product $\Pi y^B. C$: We have to prove the goal
    $(\Pi y^B. C)[x:=t] \preduce (\Pi y^B.C)[x:=u]$ from the premise $t \preduce
    u$ and the induction hypotheses  $B[x:=t] \preduce B[x:=u]$ and
    $C[x:=t] \preduce C[x:=u]$. The validity of the goal can be seen from the
    following derivation.
    $$
    \begin{array}{lllll}
        (\Pi y^B. C)[x:=t]
        &=& \Pi y^{B[x:=t]}. C[x:=t]
        &\text{definition of substitution}
        \\
        &\preduce& \Pi y^{B[x:=u]}. C[x:=u]
        &\text {induction hypothesis}
        \\
        &=& (\Pi y^B. C)[x:=u]
        &\text{definition of substitution}
    \end{array}
    $$

    \item $a$ is the abstraction $\lambda y^B. e$: Same reasoning as with
    product.

    \item $a$ is the application $f a$: Same reasoning as with
    product.
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}
    \label{ParallelReductionSubstitution2}
    \emph{Full compatibility of parallel reduction and substitution}
    $$
    \rulev{
        a \preduce b
        \\
        t \preduce u
    }
    {
        a[x:=t] \preduce b[x:=u]
    }
    $$

    \begin{proof}
        By induction on $a \preduce b$.

        \begin{enumerate}
        \item Reflexive: In that case we have $a = b$. The goal is an immediate
        consequence of lemma~\ref{ParallelReductionSubstitution1}

        \item Redex:
        $$
        \begin{array}{l|l}
            a \preduce b
            & a[x:=t] \preduce b[x:=u]
            \\
            e \preduce f
            & e[x:=t] \preduce f[x:=u]
            \\
            \hline
            (\lambda y^A. e) a \preduce f[y:=b]
            &
            ((\lambda y^A. e) a)[x:=t] \preduce f[y:=b][x:=u]
        \end{array}
        $$

        The validity of the goal in the lower right corner can be seen from the
        following reasoning:
        $$
        \begin{array}{lllll}
            ((\lambda y^A. e) a)[x:=t]
            &=& (\lambda y^{A[x:=t]}. e[x:=t]) a[x:=t]
            &\text{definition of substition}
            \\
            &\preduce& f[x:=u][y:=b[x:=t]]
            &\text{induction hypotheses}
            \\
            &=& f[y:=b][x:=u] &\text{lemma~\ref{DoubleSubstitution}}
        \end{array}
        $$

        \item Product, abstraction and application: Some reasoning as with
        \emph{redex}. The lemma~\ref{DoubleSubstitution} is not needed in these
        cases.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}
    \label{ParallelReductionProductAbstraction}
    \emph{The product and abstraction are preserved under parallel
    reduction}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
        $\ruleh{\lambda x^A. e \preduce c}
        {\exists B f. c = \lambda x^B. f
            \land A \preduce B \land e \preduce f}$

    \item
        $\ruleh{\Pi x^A. B \preduce c}
        {\exists C D. c = \Pi x^C. D
            \land A \preduce C \land B \preduce D}$
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{proof} By induction on the premise. In both cases only one rule
    is syntactically possible which guarantees the existence of the
    corresponding terms.
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}





\subsubsection{Parallel Reduction is a Diamond}


\begin{theorem}
    \label{ParallelReductionDiamond}
    \emph{Parallel reduction is a diamond}
    $$
    \ruleh{
        a \preduce b
    }
    {
        \forall c.
        \left[
        \ruleh{a \preduce c}{\exists d. b \preduce d \land c \preduce d}
        \right]
    }
    $$

    \begin{proof} By induction on $a \preduce b$.

        \begin{enumerate}
        \item Reflexive
        $$
        \begin{array}{l|l}
            a \preduce a
            &
            \forall c.
            \left[
                \ruleh{a \preduce c}{\exists d. c \preduce d \land a \preduce d}
            \right]
        \end{array}
        $$
        To prove the goal on the right side we assume $a \preduce c$. Then we use
        $c$ for $d$ which satisfies the required property of $d$ trivially.

        \item Redex
        $$
        \begin{array}{l|l}
            e \preduce f
            &
            \forall g.
            \left[
                \ruleh{e \preduce g}{\exists h. f \preduce h \land g \preduce h}
            \right]
            \\
            a \preduce b
            &
            \forall c.
            \left[
                \ruleh{b \preduce c}{\exists d. b \preduce d \land c \preduce d}
            \right]
            \\
            \hline
            (\lambda x^A. e) a \preduce f[x:=b]
            &
            \forall k.
            \left[
                \ruleh{
                    (\lambda x^A.e) a \preduce k
                }
                {
                    \exists n. k \preduce n \land f[x:=b] \preduce n
                }
            \right]
        \end{array}
        $$
        To prove the goal in the lower right corner we assume $(\lambda x^A.e)a
        \preduce k$ and do a case split on the construction of this relation.

            \begin{enumerate}
            \item Reflexive: In that case $k = (\lambda x^A. e) a$. We use $n =
            f[x:=b]$ which has the required property.


            \item Redex: In that case $k = g[x:=c]$ for some $g$ and $c$ with the
            properties $e \preduce g$ and $a \preduce c$.

            We have to find a term $n$ with $f[x:=b] \preduce n \land g[x:=c]
            \preduce n$. The term
            $$
                n = h[x:=d]
            $$
            with the terms $h$ and $d$ which exist by the induction hypotheses. It
            is easy to see that the properties
            $$
            \begin{array}{lll}
                f[x:=b] &\preduce& h[x:=d]
                \\
                g[x:=c] &\preduce& h[x:=d]
            \end{array}
            $$
            are satisfied because of the induction hypotheses and
            lemma~\ref{ParallelReductionSubstitution2}


            \item Product: This case is syntactically impossible because
            $(\lambda x^A.e) a$ cannot be a product.


            \item Abstraction: This case is syntactically impossible because
            $(\lambda x^A.e) a$ cannot be an abstraction.


            \item Application: In that case $k = (\lambda x^B. g) c$ for some
            $B$, $g$ and $c$ with $A \preduce B$, $e \preduce g$ and $a \preduce
            c$. Because of lemma~\ref{ParallelReductionProductAbstraction} we
            have chosen the more specific term $\lambda x^B. g$ instead of a
            more general term.

            We have to find a term $n$ which satisfies $(\lambda x^B. g) c
            \preduce n$ and $f[x:=b] \preduce n$.

            We use the term
            $$
                n = h[x:=d]
            $$
            with the terms $h$ and $d$ which exist by the induction hypotheses
            satisfying
            $$
            \begin{array}{lll}
                f &\preduce& h
                \\
                g &\preduce& h
                \\
                b &\preduce& d
                \\
                c &\preduce& d
            \end{array}
            $$
            Therefore the goals
            $$
            \begin{array}{lll}
                (\lambda x^B.g) c &\preduce& h[x:=d]
                \\
                f[x:=b] &\preduce& h[x:=d]
            \end{array}
            $$
            are satisfied
            \end{enumerate}


        \item Product
        $$
        \begin{array}{l|l}
            A \preduce C
            &
            \forall E.
            \left[
            \ruleh{A \preduce E}{\exists H. C \preduce H \land E \preduce H}
            \right]

            \\
            \hline
            \Pi x^A. B \preduce \Pi x^C. D

        $$
        In order to prove the goal in the lower right corner we assume $\Pi x^A.
        B \preduce \Pi x^E.F$.

        Because of lemma~\ref{ParallelReductionProductAbstraction} which says
        that parallel reduction preserves products we have chosen the more
        specific $\Pi x^E.F$ which satisfies $A \preduce E$ and $B \preduce F$
        instead of the more general $k$.

        From the induction hypotheses we conclude the existence of the terms $H$
        and $J$ such that
        $$
            n = \Pi x^H. J
        $$
        satisfies the required properties.

        \item Abstraction: Same reasoning as with product.

        \item Application

        $$
        To prove the goal in the lower right corner we assume $a b \preduce k$
        and do a case split on the construction of this relation.

            \begin{enumerate}
            \item Reflexive: In that case $k = a b$. We use $n = c d$ which
            satisfies the required properties.

            \item Redex: In this case $a b$ has to be a redex, let's say
            $(\lambda x^A.m) b$. Therefore and because of
            lemma~\ref{ParallelReductionProductAbstraction} $a b \preduce c d$
            becomes $(\lambda x^A. m) b \preduce (\lambda x^B. o) d$ for some
            $B$ and $o$ with $A \preduce B$ and $m \preduce o$.

            $k$ has to be the reduct $p[x:=f]$ for some $p$, $f$ with $m
            \preduce p$ and $b \preduce f$.

            We have to find some term $n$ which satisfies
            $$
            \begin{array}{lll}
                (\lambda x^B. o) d &\preduce& n

                p[x:=f] &\preduce& n
            \end{array}
            $$

            From the first induction hypothesis and
            lemma~\ref{ParallelReductionProductAbstraction} we postulate the
            existence of $q$ with $o \preduce q$ and $p \preduce q$.

            From the second induction hypothesis we conclude the existence of
            some $h$ with with $d \preduce h$ and $f \preduce h$.

            Therefore the term
            $$
                n = q[x:=h]
            $$ satisfies the requirement.

            \item Product: This case is syntactically impossible because $a b$
            cannot be a product.

            \item Abstraction: This case is syntactically impossible because $a b$
            cannot be an abstraction.

            \item Application: In that case $k = e f$ for some terms $e$, $f$ which
            satisfy $a \preduce e$ and $b \preduce f$. We have to find some term
            $n$ which satisfies $c d \preduce n$ and $ e f \preduce n$.

            By the induction hypotheses there exist some terms $g$ and $h$
            satisfying $c \preduce g$, $e \preduce g$, $d \preduce h$ and $f
            \preduce h$ such that the term
            $$
                n = g h
            $$
            satisfies the requirement.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
