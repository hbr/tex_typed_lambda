\section{Proof of Strong Normalization}


\subsection{Model Set}

\begin{definition}
    \emph{Model Set}
    $$
        \nu(T) :=
        \left \{
        \begin{array}{llll}
            \nu(\Prop) &:=& \SAT
            \\
            \nu(\Pi x^A. B) &:=& \nu(A)\to \nu(B) & A,B \in \Kinds
            \\
            \nu(\Pi x^A. B) &:=& \nu(B) & A \notin \Kinds \land B \in \Kinds
            \\
            \nu (T) &:=& \set{\emptyset} &\text{otherwise}
        \end{array}
        \right.
    $$
\end{definition}


The following property of $\nu$ is convenient:
$$
    \rulev{
        \Gamma \vdash t: T
        \\
        \Gamma \vdash t: U
    }
    {
        \nu(T) = \nu(U)
    }
$$


In order to prove the property we prove first a similar lemma for kinds.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{ModelEquivalentKinds}
    \emph{The model set of a kind is the same as the model set of any beta
    equivalent type}.
    $$
    \rulev{
        K \in \Kinds
        \\
        \Gamma \vdash K: \Any
        \\
        \Gamma \vdash T: s_T
        \\
        K \betaeq T
    }
    {
        \nu(K) = \nu(T)
    }
    $$

    \begin{proof}
        By induction on the structure of $K$.

        General observation: Since $K$ and $T$ are betaequivalent we get from
        theorem~\ref{TypeUniqueness3} $s_T = \Any$ and
        by~\ref{TypeAnyImpliesKind} that $T$ is a syntactical kind. This is
        valid for all induction hypotheses.

        For the induction proof we distiguish three cases:
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item $K = \Prop$: Using the general observation above we conclude that
            $T$ is a syntactical kind. $\Prop$ is the only possible syntactical
                kind beta equivalent to $\Prop$. Therefore $T = \Prop$ which
                implies the goal $\nu(T) = \nu(\Prop)$ trivially.

        \item $K = \Pi x^{K_1}. K_2$:
            Since $T$ is a syntactical kind betaequivalent to $K$ it must have
                the form of a product ($\Prop$ not possible). I.e. $T = \Pi
                x^A.B$ for some types $A$ and $B$.

            By theorem~\ref{EquivalentBinders} we get the equivalences $K_1
                \betaeq A$ and $K_2 \betaeq B$.

            From both induction hypotheses we conclude $\nu(K_1) = \nu(A)$ and
            $\nu(K_2) = \nu(B)$.


        \item $K = \Pi x^A . K_2$ (where $A \notin \Kinds$):
            By the same reasoning as above we get $T = \Pi x^{A_T}.B$ for some
            types $A_T$ and $B$ with $A \betaeq A_T$ and $ K_2 \betaeq B$.

                From the induction hypothesis we get $\nu(K_2) = \nu(B)$.

            Since both $A$ and $A_T$ are valid types and $A$ is not a
                syntactical kind, we conclude by using~\ref{TypeUniqueness3}
                that $A_T$ cannot be a syntactical kind either.

            Therefore we get
            $$
                \nu(K) = \nu(K_2) = \nu(B) = \nu(T).
            $$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}


\begin{theorem}
    $$
    \rulev{
        \Gamma \vdash t: T
        \\
        \Gamma \vdash t: U
    }
    {
        \nu(T) = \nu(U)
    }
    $$

    \begin{proof}
        From~\ref{TypeUniqueness1} we infer $T \betaeq U$ and
        from~\ref{TypeUniqueness3} we infer that either both are $\Any$ or both
        are types of the same sort.

        If both are $\Any$, then $\nu(T) = \nu(U)$ is trivial.

        Assume both are types of the same sort i.e. we have $\Gamma \vdash T: s$
        and $\Gamma \vdash U: s$. We have to distinguish $s = \Any$ and $s =
        \Prop$.

        \begin{enumerate}
        \item $s = \Any$:
            In that case the assumptions of lemma~\ref{ModelEquivalentKinds} are
                valid and we infer the goal by applying the lemma.

        \item $s = \Prop$:
            In that case neither $T$ nor $U$ are kinds and therefore by
                definition $\nu(T) = \nu(U) = \set{\emptyset}$ is valid.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}




\subsection{Context Interpretation}

\begin{definition}
    \emph{Context Interpretation}:
    We call $\xi = [x_1^{M_1}, x_2^{M_2}, \ldots, x_n^{M_n}]$ an interpretation
    of a context $\Gamma$ which we write
    $$
        \xi \vDash \Gamma
    $$
    if and only if $\Gamma = [x_1^{A_1}, x_2^{A_2}, \ldots, x_n^{A_n}]$ is a
    valid context and $M_i \in \nu(A_i)$ is valid for all $i \in \set{1, 2,
    \ldots, n}$.
\end{definition}



\subsection{Type Interpretation}

The goal of this section is to find a function which maps any welltyped term $t$
for all types $T$ it can have in a certain context $\Gamma$ into a value
$\typeinter{t}{\xi\Gamma}$ which is an element of $\nu (T)$. The function is
based on a context interpretation $\xi$ which assigns to each variable $x$ of
type $A$ in the context a model which is an element of $\nu(A)$.
