In this text we describe the calculus of constructions as one of the most
interesting typed lambda calculus. It is a sweet spot in the design space of
typed lambda calculi because it can express an immense set of computable
functions and it can express a large set of logical propositions include their
proofs.

The paper is written in a textbook style.  An expert in the field of type theory
and dependent types won't discover anything new in it. The readers who are
familiar with basic concepts of lambda calculus and computer science can get a
good unterstanding of typed lambda calculus. The needed concepts are introduced
step by step and the proofs are layed out sufficiently detailed for newcomers to
the subject.
